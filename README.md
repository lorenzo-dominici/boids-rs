# Boids-rs

Boids-rs is a Rust project that simulates boids behavior using CPU parallelization. The project also utilizes `rerun.io` as a data viewer to visualize the simulation.

## Features

- Simulates boids behavior using Rust
- Parallel computation for improved performance
- Visualization of the simulation using `rerun.io`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lorenzo-dominici/boids-rs.git
    cd boids-rs
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```

## Usage

Run the simulation:
```sh
cargo run
```

## Visualization

To visualize the simulation, ensure you have `rerun.io` installed and configured. Follow the instructions on the [rerun.io website](https://rerun.io) to set it up.
